    <h3>About us</h3>
    <section>
      <p>Power to the Shoeless (P2SL) collects and processes shoes to distribute to organizations or individuals that directly serve the homeless or those in need. We provide these shoes free of charge! By providing shoes and other items, it is our desire to improve the quality of life for those in need.
      Located in Portland, OR which has one of the highest rates of homeless in the country, P2SL is committed to serving those in need by providing direct services to organizations which support transitioning folks experiencing homelessness to comfortable living situations. We have partnered with over 100+ non-profits and community organizations in the Portland metro area and are always looking to create more positive connections. P2SL thanks you for your engaging in our mission!</p>
